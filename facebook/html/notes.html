<div class="notebody entry-content"><div><p><strong>Pulse FM 103.2</strong></p><p>Pulse FM began life as a garden shed based radio station, as with  others in this list. However, Pulse was driven strongly by commercial  forces from the beginning. On air from 1995 to 1999, its existence  coincided with a population boom in the 18–25 year age bracket. Pulse  derived much of its income from promoting underage and overage discos in  suburban Dublin, and as promoters and operators, the station management  made substantial sums from this as well as advertising DJ hire  services. Filed accounts at the CRO (No. 288948) confirm the financial  success of the station. Its backers invested heavily in CTE transmission  and modulation equipment, producing a slick, clean FM sound, clearly  received all over the Greater Dublin Area.</p><p>Pulse FM was characterised by professional, well spoken, south Dublin  posh accented DJs contrasting with the majority of other Dublin pirates  at the time. Heavily playlisted, slick voiceovers and jingle work all  combined to make Pulse FM extremely successful.</p><p>Prior to its closure, Pulse FM&#039;s owners commissioned an &#039;independent&#039;  report which put Pulse on a par with currently licenced commercial  stations such as FM104 and 98FM.</p><p>Pulse FM formed a consortium to apply for the new &#039;Youth Music&#039;  station licence, offered by the IRTC. However, this application was not  successful.</p><p>Quite a few former deejays with Pulse FM are currently on licenced radio.</p></div></div>
